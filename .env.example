# PayPal Sandbox Credentials
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_client_secret_here

# Redirect URI after payment (REQUIRED)
# This tells PayPal where to return after payment completion
# For local development:
PAYPAL_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8501

# For production:
# PAYPAL_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.streamlit.app

# Get your credentials from:
# https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications
#
# Note: Unlike OAuth, PayPal does NOT require pre-configuring redirect URI
# in the Developer Dashboard. You can use any URL - the popup will close
# automatically after detecting PayPal's callback parameters.
